notes:

NX/Angular uses Jest/Cypress instead of Karma

The following nx commands don't need npx if nx is installed globally

`npx nx serve` // same as `ng serve` except we don't leverage the caching benifits offered by nx
`npx nx list` // Lists some plugins that are possbile to install

NX allows for us to keep together our angular project and node project
