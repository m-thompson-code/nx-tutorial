notes:

NX/Angular uses Jest/Cypress instead of Karma

The following nx commands don't need npx if nx is installed globally

`npx nx serve` // same as `ng serve` except we don't leverage the caching benifits offered by nx
`npx nx list` // Lists some plugins that are possbile to install

NX allows for us to keep together our angular project and node project

`run npx nx list <plugin>` // Shows you if plugin is installed, and how to install it 

`npx nx g @nrwl/nest:app <node project name> --frontendProject=<angular app prefix>` // generate nest node project for angular project

`npx nx g @nrwl/workspace:lib <lib name>` // generates shareable lib (all apps can access this code)
